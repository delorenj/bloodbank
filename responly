# Goal
Generate an idiomatic git commit message.

## Requirements
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                    Assistant: <thinking>
To generate an idiomatic git commit message, I need to follow best 
practices for commit messages. This typically includes:
1. A concise subject line (50 characters or less)
2. A blank line separating the subject from the body
3. A detailed body (wrapped at 72 characters) explaining what and 
why, not how
4. Use of imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
5. Reference to any relevant issues or tickets
</thinking>

Here's a template for an idiomatic git commit message:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Where:
- `<type>`: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, 
refactor, test, chore)
- `<scope>`: The scope of the change (optional, e.g., module or 
component name)
- `<subject>`: A brief description of the change
- `<body>`: A detailed explanation of the change
- `<footer>`: Reference to issues or breaking changes (optional)

Example commit message:

```
feat(authentication): add OAuth2 support

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow to allow users to sign in with 
Google
and GitHub accounts. This includes new endpoints for OAuth2 
callbacks and
token management.

Closes #123
```

Would you like me to generate a specific commit message based on 
some changes? If so, please describe the changes you've made.
User: 
First line contains a concise high-level description of the 
change(s).
- Second line should be left blank
- (Conditional) A change log breaking the changes down into 
individual high-level descriptions of each change made.
    - Depending on the complexity of the change(s), including the 
number of files changed, apparent complexity, etc, this section may 
be omitted.
    - If the change(s) are determined to be somewhat trivial, making
the change log overkill, you may only submit the first line summary.
    - As a general rule of thumb, if the change(s) can be broken 
into at least 3 high-level descriptions of non-overlapping tasks and
non-redundant change log entries, then do NOT omit the change log.

HOW YOU ARRIVED AT IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE "Here's an idiomatic 
commit message for you!" ETC...

+Short subject line (50 chars or less)

+More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
+characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as 
the
+subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
+blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
+you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
+and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
+
+Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
+are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
+Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
+change? Here's the place to explain them.
+
+Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
+
+ - Bullet points are okay, too
+
+ - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
+   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
+   vary here
+
+If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
+like this:
+
+Resolves: #123
+See also: #456, #789

than

++
+```
++feat: add new feature to handle user authentication
++
++- Implemented user login and registration functionality
++- Added password hashing for security
++- Updated documentation to reflect new changes
++
```
++
++This message follows the conventional commit format, which is 
+widely
++used in the industry. The `feat:` prefix indicates a new feature, 
++and the body provides additional details about the changes.
